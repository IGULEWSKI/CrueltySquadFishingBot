While having rod in hand and next to pond press q to start fishing:
Bot works by analyzing ingame sound, so loud sound in game may also be interpreted as catching fish.
Bot works on (my ingame settings) so u may to adjust FishBot.py glos>0.007 and glos<0.009 to your need (muting music is recommended).
To terminate press q again.
